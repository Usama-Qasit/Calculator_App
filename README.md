**Calculator App**

**Description**

A calculator app is a mobile app that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.
The app can be built using the Flutter SDK, which is an open-source software development kit for building beautiful UI which is natively compiled.
The app would need to have the following features:
A grid of buttons representing the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
A text field to display the current calculation.
A button to clear the current calculation.

**Here are some of the benefits of building a calculator app in Flutter**
Flutter is a cross-platform SDK, which means that the app can be built once and deployed to both iOS and Android devices.
Flutter is a powerful SDK that allows for the creation of beautiful and responsive UIs.
Flutter is easy to learn and use, even for beginners.
